# Text-to-Speech

## Overview

Welcome to the Text-to-Speech project! This is my first machine learning project, where I explore the implementation of converting text into speech using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description

This project involves creating a model that can convert written text into spoken words. The model is trained on a dataset of text and corresponding speech data. The goal is to produce a natural-sounding voice output from the text input.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Provide any text input to the model.
- **Speech Output**: The model generates a corresponding speech output.
- **Colab Notebook**: An interactive Google Colab notebook is available for running and experimenting with the model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Colab Notebook (preferable) but you can use jupyter also just need to install the required dependencies

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/brightchild200/Text-to-Speech.git
   cd Text-to-Speech
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the Notebook**:
   Open the `finaltexttospeech.ipynb` notebook and run the model.

## Usage

1. **Provide Text Input**: Enter the text you want to convert to speech in the provided cell.
2. **Generate Speech Output**: Run the cell to generate and listen to the speech output.

## Colab Notebook
